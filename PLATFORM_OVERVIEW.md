## 🎯 What This Platform Does

The platform acts as a centralized hub for the entire placement lifecycle, connecting four key stakeholders:

- **For Students**: A "Gen-Z" native personal dashboard to build professional profiles, showcase skills, track their hiring "journey," and apply for dream roles.
- **For Campus POCs**: A dedicated management portal to verify student profiles, approve skills, and provide hyper-local support for their campus students.
- **For Placement Coordinators**: A powerful command center to create job postings, manage application pipelines using Kanban boards, and monitor recruitment funnels.
- **For Managers**: High-level analytics and reporting tools to track placement statistics across multiple campuses and companies.
