## 📋 NEW REQUIREMENTS (To Implement)

### 1. Enhanced Job Eligibility System

#### 1.1 Requirements Field Enhancement
**Current:** Simple text requirements list
**New:** Interactive requirements with student self-assessment

```
For each requirement:
- Requirement text (entered by coordinator)
- Student response: Yes/No toggle
- Used to calculate match percentage
```

#### 1.2 Required Skills with Proficiency Levels
**Current:** Select skills (binary)
**New:** Select skills + required proficiency level (1-4)

```
Skill Selection UI:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ JavaScript    [■■■□] Level 3 required   │
│ React         [■■□□] Level 2 required   │
│ Node.js       [■■■■] Level 4 required   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Levels:
1 = Beginner
2 = Intermediate  
3 = Advanced
4 = Expert
```

#### 1.3 Eligibility Criteria Restructure
**New Structure:**
```
Education Requirements:
├── 10th Grade
│   ├── Required: Yes/No
│   └── Min Percentage: ___ (optional)
├── 12th Grade
│   ├── Required: Yes/No
│   └── Min Percentage: ___ (optional)
└── Degree
    ├── Required: Yes/No
    └── Specific Degree: Dropdown (only if Yes)
        └── Show only degrees present in active student database

School Requirements:
├── Schools: Multi-select (default: All)
│   └── Show: School of Programming, Business, Finance, etc.
└── Module Requirements (per school):
    └── Select minimum module (hierarchical - lower modules auto-selected)

Campus Requirements:
└── Campuses: Multi-select (default: All)
```

---

### 2. Enhanced Job Matching & Application Flow

#### 2.1 Match Percentage Calculation
**Formula:**
```
Match % = (
  (Matching Skills Score × 40%) +
  (Proficiency Level Match × 30%) +
  (Requirements Match × 20%) +
  (Eligibility Match × 10%)
) / 100
```

**Display:**
- Show "67% Match" badge on job cards
- Color coding: Green (80%+), Yellow (60-79%), Orange (40-59%), Red (<40%)

#### 2.2 Application Flow Based on Match

| Match % | Button | Flow |
|---------|--------|------|
| ≥60% | "Apply" | Direct application |
| <60% | "Show Interest" | Goes to Campus PoC for approval |

**Interest Request Flow:**
```
Student shows interest
    ↓
Campus PoC sees in dashboard
    ↓
├── Approve → Student can apply normally
└── Reject → Must provide reason → Student notified
```

---

### 3. Self-Application Section (Student Side)

#### 3.1 Purpose
Allow students to record jobs they applied to externally (not through platform)

#### 3.2 Fields
```
Self Application Form:
├── Company Name *
├── Job Title *
├── Job Type (Full-time/Part-time/Internship/Contract)
├── Application Date *
├── Source (LinkedIn/Company Website/Referral/Other)
├── Job Link (optional)
├── Contact Person (optional)
├── Status: Applied/In Process/Selected/Rejected
├── Salary Offered (if selected)
└── Notes
```

#### 3.3 Dashboard Impact
- Count in "Total Applications" metric
- Separate section in student applications view
- Campus PoC can view/edit if student doesn't fill

---

### 4. Bulk Upload Feature (Campus PoC)

#### 4.1 Student Data Upload
**CSV Format for Job-Ready Students:**
```csv
email,firstName,lastName,phone,school,module,campus,10thPercentage,12thPercentage,degree,cgpa
student1@ng.edu,John,Doe,9876543210,School of Programming,React,Bangalore,85,78,B.Tech,8.5
```

#### 4.2 Self-Application Bulk Upload
**CSV Format:**
```csv
studentEmail,companyName,jobTitle,jobType,applicationDate,source,status,salaryOffered

```

#### 4.3 UI Features
- Download sample CSV button
- Upload with validation
- Error report for failed rows
- Preview before import

---

### 5. Job Readiness Criteria System

#### 5.1 Criteria Configuration (Manager/Campus PoC)
Each school can have custom job readiness criteria.

**Default for School of Programming:**

## ✅ COMPLETED: AI-Assisted JD Parsing (Jan 13, 2026)

### Implementation Summary
- **Code-based hybrid parsing**: Zero quota usage for basic extraction
- **Automatic key rotation**: 2-5 API keys with seamless fallback
- **Graceful degradation**: Never fails completely on quota exhaustion
- **Error code mapping**: Clear error messages (QUOTA_EXCEEDED, RATE_LIMITED, etc)
- **Coordinator Settings**: Personal API key management UI (up to 5 keys)

### Architecture
```
Parse Request
  → Step 1: Code-based extraction (regex) - NO API CALLS
  → Step 2: If minimal results + AI available → Try AI parsing (fills gaps)
  → Step 3: On quota error → Continue with code results (graceful fallback)
```

### Next Steps When Resuming
- Manager global settings UI for multi-key configuration
- Health polling dashboard for quota monitoring
- Integration tests for error scenarios

---

## 📝 Notes
- All percentages should be configurable in Settings
- Consider mobile responsiveness for student checklist
- Add email notifications for status changes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing jobs/applications

## 📋 NEW REQUIREMENT: Gated Profile Approval (Resume + LinkedIn + Portfolio)

### Objective
Make profile approval stricter and auditable by enforcing:
- Profile completion must be at least 80%.
- Resume, LinkedIn, and Portfolio must each be reviewed and approved by Campus PoC.
- These checks become part of the final profile approval flow.

### Business Rules
1. Student cannot submit profile unless:
- Profile completion score >= 80.
- Resume exists (file or link).
- LinkedIn URL exists.
- Portfolio URL exists.

2. PoC cannot mark final profile as approved unless all are true:
- Profile completion score >= 80.
- Resume status = approved.
- LinkedIn status = approved.
- Portfolio status = approved.

3. If student edits any approved asset later:
- That asset resets to pending.
- Profile status moves out of approved state (draft or pending_approval based on action).
- PoC re-review required only for changed assets.

### Data Model Additions (studentProfile)
Add approval-tracking object:

```javascript
studentProfile: {
  assetApprovals: {
    resume: {
      status: 'pending|approved|rejected',
      reviewedBy: ObjectId,
      reviewedAt: Date,
      reviewerNote: String,
      submittedValue: String
    },
    linkedIn: {
      status: 'pending|approved|rejected',
      reviewedBy: ObjectId,
      reviewedAt: Date,
      reviewerNote: String,
      submittedValue: String
    },
    portfolio: {
      status: 'pending|approved|rejected',
      reviewedBy: ObjectId,
      reviewedAt: Date,
      reviewerNote: String,
      submittedValue: String
    }
  },
  profileCompletionScore: Number
}
```

### API/Backend Changes
1. Submission guard (`POST /users/profile/submit`):
- Validate 80% completion and required assets present.
- Initialize asset statuses to pending if newly submitted/changed.

2. Asset review endpoint (new):
- `PUT /users/students/:studentId/profile/assets/:assetType/review`
- Roles: campus_poc, coordinator, manager.
- Body: status + reviewerNote.

3. Final approval endpoint (`PUT /users/students/:studentId/profile/approve`):
- Add hard validation for all gates before allowing status=approved.

4. Auto-reset logic on student edit (`PUT /users/profile`):
- If resume/linkedin/portfolio changes, mark corresponding asset approval as pending.

### PoC UI Flow (Profile Approvals Page)
1. Student row/detail modal shows a "Readiness Gate" card:
- Profile completion score (must be >= 80).
- Resume status + approve/reject controls.
- LinkedIn status + approve/reject controls.
- Portfolio status + approve/reject controls.

2. Final Approve button behavior:
- Disabled until all gates pass.
- Tooltip/message indicates missing gates.

3. Revision flow:
- PoC can reject individual asset with reason.
- Student sees asset-level feedback and updates only required fields.

### Integration with Job Readiness
- Resume/LinkedIn/Portfolio criteria remain in job readiness where needed.
- Asset approval state becomes the source of truth for profile approval gating.
- Basic Job Readiness can depend on these approvals if configured.

### Rollout Plan
Phase 1:
- Backend schema + validation guards + new asset review endpoint.

Phase 2:
- PoC approval UI for asset-level review and final gate.

Phase 3:
- Student feedback UX (clear pending/rejected reasons per asset).

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in profiles approved without verified links.
- Faster PoC review turnaround due to section-wise approvals.
- Lower rework by students due to targeted revision feedback.
